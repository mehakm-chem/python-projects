# python-projects
 This repository contains two big projects from my first Computer Science class : Programming and Problem Solving. 

The first project: DNA search identifies the text file containing dna informationand returns who that dna text file correspond to.

The second project : Wild fire Simulation is a graphical python program which allows the user to observe the way fire spreads, in addition to automatically computing statistics about the fire, including how much of the forest was destroyed, and how long the fire burned. The program allows the user to enter different probabilities of fire spreading.
